/**
 * <h1><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/index.html">
 * Classes and Objects</a></h1>
 * <p>With the knowledge you now have of the basics of the Java programming
 * language, you can learn to write your own classes. In this
 * lesson, you will find information about defining your own classes, including
 * declaring member variables, methods, and constructors.</p>
 * <p>You will learn to use your classes to create objects, and how to use
 * the objects you create.</p>
 * <p>This package also covers nesting classes within other classes, and
 * enumerations.</p><br /
 * <h2><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html">
 * Classes</a></h2>
 * <p>This section shows you the anatomy of a class, and how to declare fields,
 * methods, and constructors.</p><br />
 * <h2><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/objects.html">
 * Objects</a></h2>
 * <p>This section covers creating and using objects. You will learn how to
 * instantiate an object, and, once instantiated, how to use the
 * <code>dot</code>
 * operator to access the object's instance variables and methods.</p><br />
 * <h2><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/more.html">
 * More on Classes</a></h2>
 * <p> This section covers more aspects of classes that depend on using object
 * references and the <code>dot</code> operator that you learned about in the
 * preceding section:<br />
 * returning values from methods, the <code>this</code> keyword, class vs.
 * instance members, and access control.</p><br />
 * <h2><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html">
 * Nested Classes</a></h2>
 * <p>Static nested classes, inner classes, anonymous inner classes, local
 * classes, and lambda expressions are covered. There is also a discussion on
 * when to use which approach.</p><br />
 * <h2><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html">
 * Enum Types</a></h2>
 * <p>This section covers enumerations, specialized classes that allow you to
 * define and use sets of constants.</p><br />
